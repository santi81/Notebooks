# TF_Intro_Notebooks

This is a codelab material for TensorFlow introduction with data from Google BigQuery downloaded as CSV. 
Get started from the '0. Preparation.ipynb' notebook.

Install Anaconda for your OS: https://www.continuum.io/downloads.

Once Anaconda is installed, open a command prompt and test by running the following command: jupyter-notebook.

If successful, this command would open a browser window.
Close the browser, hit Ctrl+C on your command prompt and run the following command: pip install tensorflow.

If all goes well, you can clone this repository and run jupyter-notebook from the folder where you downloaded the repo.

This repository is built on the notebooks available from https://github.com/kazunori279/TensorFlow-Intro/
